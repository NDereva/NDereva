ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Nikolay, I am a recent Economics PhD graduate from Ukraine 
My thesis was related to Market Power in Food Supply Chains, so you can find some project related to my thesis here. 
During my PhD studies, I've developed a surprising interest in data analysis and applied statistics, so I'd like to keep up developing further in this area.
I'm curious about Bayesian Multilevel Models, Causal Inference and about Julia programming language.
